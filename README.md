# Web Chat Application

Hello! Welcome to my GitHub repo for a real-time chat application. The client side of the web app is built with React, and server-side code is written using Node JS, and Socket.IO to allow communication between clients and the server. Users can enter a username and country, and select a chat room to join to begin sending and receiving messages from other users in real-time.

## Features

- Join chat rooms with a unique username
- Send and receive chat room messages in real-time
- Multiple chat room support
- Simple and intuitive user interface
